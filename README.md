# A Repository for a "template" MotionEye docker setup

This is currently under **HEAVY** development. Feel free to contribute, and I'll try my best to add your ideas and contributions as best I can!

## What is this?

This will *eventually* be a repository for a "template" MotionEye docker setup. It will include a docker-compose file, a dockerfile, and a few other things to make it easier to get up and running with MotionEye, in a dockerized setting, on Windows, Linux, or macOS.
